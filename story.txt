Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. 

When he fell, they glued him back together right away. He had a great fall, yet you couldn't tell at all. Miraculous recovery by the kings men.

After he awoke from the surgery, he and his family went to his favorite restaurant, Olive Garden. He got unlimited breadsticks and took most of his main course meal to go. "I don't understand how this place makes a profit giving away so many free breadsticks" he thought to himself.
